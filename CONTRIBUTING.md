# Contributing

Contributing to Picasso is easy: just open a [pull
request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/). Make
`master` the destination branch on the [Picasso
repository](https://github.com/PicassoDev/Picasso) and allow edits from
maintainers in the pull request.

Your pull request must pass Picasso's tests, which includes using the coding
style from `.clang-format` (enforced with clang-format-14) and adding doxygen
documentation, and be reviewed by at least one Picasso developer.

`pre-commit` is a useful tool for ensuring feature branches are ready for
review by running automatic checks locally before a commit is made.
[Installation details](https://pre-commit.com/#install) (once per system) and
[activation details](https://pre-commit.com/#usage) (once per repo) are
available.
